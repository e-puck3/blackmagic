Black Magic Probe
=================

This repository is a fork of the [BlackMagic GDB server](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic).
It contains some modifications in order to use it as a submodule for a ChibiOS project.

More info in the dedicated [readme.md](Template_for_ChibiOs/readme.md)

**Note:** Jtag support has been disabled.

**Note 2:** The SWD communication have been tested with MCU frequency from 46MHz to 216MHz (programmer side). It's not guaranteed it will work outside of this range.
